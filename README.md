## Introduction

Millions of people fly on US airlines every month and a good flying expereince always makes for happier travel. In this project, we developed a app called **AirPlan** and the goal is to help customers choose the best airline to fly with. In particular, we focus on 14 major US airlines and provide airline choices based on their on-time performance, safety performance, luggage handling, in-flight service, and price.



## What is the Business Problem Solved?
Which airline is the best to fly is a problem faced by many travellers before their trip. **Airplan**, unlike traditional airline planning websites which focus primarily on in-flight service or price, dugs through more criteria covering every aspect of each airline’s operations.

## Criteria
1. On-time performance
2. Safety performance
3. Average price
4. Food & Drink
5. Entertainment
6. Seat comfort
7. Stuff service
8. Value for money
9. Luggage handling
